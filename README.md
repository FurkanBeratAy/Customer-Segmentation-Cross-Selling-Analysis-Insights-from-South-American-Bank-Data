# Customer-Segmentation-Cross-Selling-Analysis-Insights-from-South-American-Bank-Data

## Background/Problem
This project investigates the cross-selling strategies of a South American bank, focusing on identifying factors that influence customers' likelihood to make multiple purchases or transactions. The goal is to understand why the bank's current approach has limited success in driving more than one sale per customer and recommend potential improvements.

## Key Areas of Analysis
- **Employment Analysis:** Investigating customer employment data to identify patterns related to purchasing behavior.
- **Age Range of Customers:** Analyzing the demographic distribution and its correlation to cross-selling success.
- **Customer Activity at the Beginning of the Month:** Exploring customer activity early in the month to assess patterns that might influence sales behavior.
- **Top 25 Channels Used:** Identifying the most effective channels for customer interaction and sales.
- **Bottom 25 Channel Usage:** Analyzing underperforming channels to recommend areas of improvement.
- **Deceased Index:** Examining the impact of deceased customers on sales and activity data.
- **Activity Index in General:** A general index of customer activity to gauge engagement levels across different demographics.
- **Segmentation:** Segmenting customers based on various factors (age, activity, channels, etc.) to uncover patterns of behavior.
- **Overall Correlations:** Exploring correlations between customer characteristics and their likelihood to engage in cross-selling opportunities.
- **Model Recommendations:** Developing models to predict customer behavior and recommend tailored cross-selling strategies.
- **Conclusion:** Summarizing findings and providing actionable insights to improve the bank's sales strategy.

## Data Sources
This project utilizes anonymized customer data provided by the South American bank, including transaction history, demographic information, and customer engagement metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Analysis and documentation.

## Slideshow for Stakeholders
To effectively communicate the findings and recommendations to the bank's stakeholders, a slideshow was created. This was important for several reasons:
- **Clarity:** A slideshow allows for a clear and concise presentation of complex data insights.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Visualizations and summarized points help keep stakeholders engaged and focused on the key takeaways.
- **Actionable Insights:** The slideshow format provides a structured way to present actionable recommendations that stakeholders can easily follow and implement.
- **Decision-Making Support:** Stakeholders often make decisions based on the information presented, and a well-structured slideshow ensures the most important data and insights are highlighted.

## Future Work
- Refining models for better prediction accuracy.
- Integrating more granular customer interaction data.
- Developing real-time cross-selling strategies.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior, identifying key areas for improvement in the bank's cross-selling strategies. By leveraging data-driven models, the bank can enhance its sales efforts and better serve its customers.
